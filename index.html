                        What Is A Classical Baptist Church?
                        By Dr. John S. Waldrip
                    </strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    What is a classical Baptist Church? Let me begin by answering that there is no unanimity among
                    Baptists on this issue since Baptists have historically been committed to the autonomy of the local
                    congregation as opposed to the denominational oversight of congregations so typical of the Church
                    of Rome and the mainline Protestant organizations. However, from this pastor’s perspective, several
                    features may be consistently found in what I envision to be classical Baptists:
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, classical Baptists are Baptists that are committed to Gospel preaching. Strange as this may
                    sound, many these days (including Baptists) seem to have abandoned Gospel preaching in favor of
                    what is commonly referred to as expository preaching. However, the risen Savior related all
                    Scripture to Himself in Luke 24.27.

                    Thus, real exposition of God’s Word involves showing how everything in the Bible points to the
                    Gospel. No wonder some of the most astute Bible preachers in history (among them notable Baptists)
                    had congregations that were thoroughly conversant in Bible truth because their exposure to the
                    gospel from texts throughout God’s Word acquainted them with the core and theme of the Bible
                    message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, classical Baptists are Baptists that are committed to an approach to evangelism that has
                    largely fallen out of favor since the impact of Charles G. Finney’s ministry has been felt. Finney,
                    exposing himself in his writings as a follower of Pelagius, was opposed to monergism, the notion
                    that the salvation of a sinner originates with God rather than being the combined effort of God and
                    man. Sadly, many Baptists succumbed to the influence of Finney over the past two centuries for
                    pragmatic reasons, not recognizing that his philosophy of revival and evangelism is based on a
                    deeply flawed understanding of man’s depravity and Christ’s saving work. Thus, the classical
                    Baptist’s model for effective evangelism is first God’s Word and second influenced by such notables
                    as Jonathan Edwards, Charles H. Spurgeon, George Whitefield, Adoniram Judson, and William Carey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, classical Baptists are deeply committed to the reality and implications of a sinner’s
                    depravity. The result of this commitment is an understanding that the sinner’s heart is deceitful
                    and incapable of unaided honesty. Therefore, it is crucial to any consideration of administering
                    believer baptism or admitting into Church membership that the candidate’s conversion testimony,
                    comprehension of the Gospel, and manner of life since conversion be carefully considered. To accept
                    as true a person’s declaration that he is a Christian, without discerning clarification, is an
                    unwarranted and dangerous violation of the biblical principle that nothing is to be accepted as
                    true which does not have the attestation of two or three witnesses of fact (Numbers 35.30;
                    Deuteronomy 17.6-7; Joshua 24.22; Ruth 4.9-11; Job 10.17; Isaiah 8.2; 43.9-12; 44.8-9; Jeremiah
                    32.10, 12, 25, 44; Matthew 18.15-20; Luke 24.46-48; Acts 1.8; 2.32; 3.15; 5.32; 10.39-40; 13.31; 2
                    Corinthians 13.1; 1 Thessalonians 2.10; 1 Timothy 5.19; 6.12; Hebrews 10.28; 1 John 4.1; 5.7-9;
                    Revelation 1.1; 2.2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fourth, classical Baptists are convinced the new birth is a transformative miracle that is wrought
                    by the Holy Spirit in the life of the sinner who comes to Jesus Christ in response to his exposure
                    to the Gospel message. To many these days, there is no expectation of a different manner of life
                    following conversion. However, the English Baptist pastor and author John Bunyan articulated an
                    understanding of the new birth in his widely read Pilgrim’s Progress that is consistent with
                    classical Baptist convictions about this matter. Do Christian’s sin? Sadly, we do sin. However, the
                    blood-bought and blood-washed child of God is not the same person and does not live the same life
                    after conversion as he did before His saving encounter with Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fifth, classical Baptists strongly resist the tendency of some to be tossed about by every wind of
                    change and the latest fads. We embrace an old message communicated to sinners the old way and decry
                    the depersonalization of contemporary evangelism. Though the Christian life is personal, it is not
                    private and is intended to be lived with others in the congregation. In like manner, the Gospel
                    ministry may be conducted on a large scale to masses as well as to individuals, though conversion
                    occurs when Jesus becomes the personal savior through the faith of the sinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sixth, classical Baptists reject the Protestant view of the Church set forth in the Westminster
                    Confession of Faith (Chapter XXV – Of the Church), as well as the view of the Church set forth in
                    what is commonly referred to as the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 (Chapter XXVI
                    – Of the Church). Classical Baptists embrace the conviction that the Church of Jesus Christ was
                    established by the Savior during His earthly ministry, empowered by the Spirit on the Day of
                    Pentecost, and subsequently divided into multiple congregations that established other Churches.
                    Only in heaven will the Church be universal and consist of all Church Age believers in Jesus Christ
                    (Hebrews 12.23).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, classical Baptists are missionary Baptists, recognizing our Great Commission is rightly
                    obeyed when Christians render service to Christ to, through, and from congregations where there is
                    accountability, the administration of the two ordinances, and properly administered discipline, and
                    when congregations are involved in starting other Churches to carry out the Great Commission in
                    other places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are but a few of the marks of a classical Baptist, as understood by one Baptist pastor. A
                    classical Baptist Church, therefore, agrees with these marks and seeks to exemplify them.
